![META VaR Histogram](charts/var_hist.png)

**Insights:**
- The histogram of daily returns for META shows a mostly normal distribution centered around 0%.
- There are some strong negative outliers.
- Historical VaR (95% confidence): **~ -2.59%**  
- Parametric VaR (95% confidence): **~ -2.53%**

Value at Risk (VaR) helps quantify the maximum expected loss over a given time period with a specific confidence level ‚Äî it's a critical measure for financial risk management.

In our case, we computed one-day VaR at a 95% confidence level using two methods:

Historical VaR: 2.59%

Parametric VaR (assuming normal distribution): 2.53%  

This means that with 95% confidence, we expect that META's daily loss will not exceed 2.59% (historical) or 2.53% (parametric) on most trading days.
